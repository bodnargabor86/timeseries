# Goal: Predict bike renting using Time Series techniques.

The project is based on the following publication and data:

Fanaee-T, Hadi, and Gama, Joao, "Event labeling combining ensemble detectors and background knowledge", Progress in Artificial Intelligence (2013): pp. 1-15, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, doi:10.1007/s13748-013-0040-3.

Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions, precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors. The core data set is related to
the two-year historical log corresponding to years 2011 and 2012 from Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is publicly available in http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information are extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com.


**I am performing EDA using Time Series Analysis techniques EDA includes decomposition, correlation analysis, and tests for stationarity.
Construct the baseline model using Linear Regression keeping in data only endogenous features.
I train an ARIMA model.**
